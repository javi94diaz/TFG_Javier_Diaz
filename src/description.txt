Need some help? 

Here you can find the description of every item of the interface. Search the page you want to 
learn about and read.

	-HOME: here you can see the main cover of the application. This application has been 
developed in Python by a student of the ETSII UPM, as the bottom icons show.

	-SOLVER: type a first order Ordinary Differential Equation and solve it quickly 
with this compact ODE Calculator. It uses the Lie Group Symmetries to search for the 
infinitesimal functions of the ODE, and then solves it easily for the user.

	-STEP-BY-STEP: this is an advanced mode of the previous ODE Solver. Here you will be 
able to obtain the infinitesimal group for your equations, give your own infinitesimals and
finally solve them diving into details using the Lie groups hint.

	-BENCHMARK: This section shows the results of the project. Here you can test and launch
a set of equations known as KAMKE Set. We have selected the first 88 for you to test them with
a wide variety of hints. This section will also show measured times, and give you detailed
results of any test you perform.

	-HELP: Well, it seems like you know how this part works if you are reading this test. 
Anyway, this section contains a brief description of all sections and its functionality, as
you can read all above.

Thanks for using DELHI App,

Developers Team
